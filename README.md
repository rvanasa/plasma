# Plasma

A deprecated Node.js package for defining functional reactive programming systems.
The concept is essentially a crossover between the Promise and Observer patterns, using so-called Resources to propagate changes in state to subscribed Listeners.

I'm currently in the progress of completely revamping the Resource paradigm to improve error handling and interoperability with ES6 promises.
In the meantime, feel free to reach out if you would like to contribute or have any interesting ideas for the future of the project.
